# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles - that is, my configuration files for most Unix things that matter.

In order to link the actual `whatever` files that live under my home directory to these files, I run `rcup` from the `rcm` suite. [`rcm`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) is a set of utilities to link dotfiles.

## Other utilities

I expect the following to be installed:

* [direnv](http://direnv.net/)
* [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd)
