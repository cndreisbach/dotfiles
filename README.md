# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles - that is, my configuration files for most Unix things that matter.

In order to link the actual `.whatever` files that live under my home directory to these files, I run `./bin/dfm`. [`dfm`](https://github.com/justone/dfm) is a simple utility to link dotfiles.

These files were made to work on OS X 10.7 and Ubuntu 13.04. They're not guaranteed to work anywhere else, but most will likely be fine in any Unix environment.

Thanks for checking them out! - Clinton N. Dreisbach
