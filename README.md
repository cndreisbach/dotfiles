# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles - that is, my configuration files for most Unix things that matter. In order to link the actual `.whatever` files that live under my home directory to these files, I run `rake`. See the `Rakefile` for more info on that.

These files were made to work on a laptop running Ubuntu 11.04. They're not guaranteed to work anywhere else, but most will likely be fine in any Unix environment.

Thanks for checking them out! - Clinton R. Nixon
